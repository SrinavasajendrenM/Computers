  <h3 class="intro">Welcome to our group's HTML website for the Hardware Project.</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, we will be exploring the computer system, specifically the pieces of hardware that make it up. Here are the main things that will be covered:
    <ul>
      <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU / Processor)</li>
      <li>Motherboard (Mainboard / System Board / Logicboard / MoBo)</li>
      <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
      <li>Floppy Disk Drive (FDD)</li>
      <li>Optical Disk Drive (ODD / CD/DVD-ROM Drive)</li>
      <li>Random Access Memory (RAM / Memory)</li>
      <li>Computer Case (System Unit / Computer Chassis / Tower / Base Unit / Case)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's get started on how the Computer looked before we deconstructed it...<br>

  <h3 class= "intro">Central Processing Unit (CPU / Processor)</h3>
  <p>The CPU is a miniaturized electronic component that can be referred to as the brain of the PC. It is responsible for two things:
Carries out commands to make the hardware components perform actions. 
Processes data; controls the execution of a computer and which performs basic arithmetic and logical operations. 
Although the instructions performed by the CPU are relatively simple, the CPU can execute many millions of instructions every second. This is what makes the PC such a powerful tool.
