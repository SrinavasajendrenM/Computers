  <h3 class="intro">Welcome to our group's HTML website for the Hardware Project</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, we will be exploring the computer system, specifically the pieces of hardware 
    that make it up. Here are the main things that will be covered:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU / Processor)</li>
    <li>CPU Cooling Fans</li>

    Let's get started on how the computer looked before we deconstructed it...
  </p>

      As you can see, opening the computer case was all we had done prior to this picture being taken.

  <p>
    A computer case, otherwise called a computer chassis, tower, system unit, cabinet, base unit, or simply case, is the fenced in area 
    that contains the greater part of the components of a computer (more often not including the display, keyboard, and mouse). The 
    material usually used to create cases are SECC—Steel, electrogalvanized (created by applying zinc and strip by electrodeposition), 
    icy moved, curl, or aluminum. Plastic is some of the time utilized, and different materials, for instance, glass, wood and even 
    Lego blocks have showed up in do it yourself or home-built cases. The computer case protects and holds together all the pieces that 
    are mandatory for a computer to function.

  <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The CPU was one of the first parts our group had managed to pull out of the computer, it is commonly referred to as the "brains" of 
    a computer. The CPU is also known as the processor. The CPU is responsible for executing a program.
    It is responsible for two things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Carrying out commands to make the hardware components perform actions.</li> 
    <li>Processing data; controls the execution of a computer and which performs basic arithmetic and logical operations.</li> 
  </ul>
  <p>
    Although the instructions performed by the CPU are relatively simple, the CPU can execute many millions of instructions every second. 
    This is what makes the PC such a powerful tool.
  </p>

      Our computer was using an Intel® Pentium® 4 processor (top-left), seen here beside the Floppy Disk Drive (right).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The CPU is a scaled down electronic segment that can be alluded to as the mind of the PC. It is in charge of two things: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It creates orders to influence the equipment segments to perform activities.</li> 
    <li>Processes information; controls the execution of a PC and which performs fundamental math and sensible operations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Despite the fact that the directions performed by the CPU are moderately straightforward, the CPU can execute a large number of 
    guidelines consistently. This is the thing that makes the PC such an intense device.

  <h3>CPU Cooling Fan</h3>
  <p>
    We had already detached the CPU cooling fan, and heatsink, prior to detaching the CPU, it removes the waste heat produced by the CPU, to keep it within permissible operating temperature limits.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="fan2.jpg" alt="CPU Cooling Fan">
    <figcaption>
      The cooling fan (right) and heatsink (left) were mounted on top of the CPU.

  <h3>Motherboard</h3>
  <p>
    Although we had managed to take out the CPU quickly, the motherboard took quite a while to detach, 
    it is a printed circuit board that is known as the foundation of a computer. It allocates power and 
    allows communication to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components. 
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="motherboard2.jpg" alt="Motherboard">
    <figcaption>
      Our motherboard was located at the bottom of our computer case.

  <h3>Riser Card</h3>
  <p>
    We managed to detach the riser card immediately after pulling out the motherboard, it is a board that 
    plugs into the motherboard and provides additional expansion slots. Because it rises above 
    the motherboard, it enables you to connect additional adapters to the system in an orientation that 
    is parallel to the system board and save space within the computer case.
  </p>
  <figure>

      Our riser card was connected to the motherboard, located by the PSU.

  <h3>Random Access Memory (RAM / memory)</h3>
  <p>
    IDK.
  </p>

  <p>
    RAM is utilized as a method for briefly saving data utilized by different segments of a PC. Any data inside RAM will be lost when a PC is reset or fueled off. 
    For instance, the CPU uses RAM for the transitory stockpiling of projects and information. 
    The primary memory that enables projects and information to be stacked for execution. 
    Temporary (short term or volatile) memory and the contents in it can be overwritten.
    Holds the program and information that the CPU is at present preparing. 
    Advantage: by adding more RAM to a PC, the execution of the PC upgrades and more projects can be introduced and keep running in the meantime. 
    Disadvantage: if power loss happens, all the contents that were stored in the memory are lost.
  </p>

  <h3>Power Supply Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The PSU was the last part our group pulled out of the computer, it sends low-voltage power to the 
    internal components of a computer. Modern PCs universally use power supplies with switches. Some power 
    supplies have a manual switch for selecting the input and output voltage, while others automatically 
    adapt to the source.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      Our computer's Power Supply Unit was screwed into the Computer Case, and had a protective cover, so it took quite some time to take it out.

  <h3>Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
  <p>
    The FDD was one of the first parts our groups had managed to pull out of the computer, it is a magnetic 
    storage drive for computers. The floppy disk is composed of a thin, flexible magnetic disk sealed in a 
    square plastic carrier (it looks like the save icon on most word-processing applications). In order to 
    read and write data from a floppy disk, a computer system must have a floppy disk drive.
  </p>

      Our computer's Floppy Disk Drive (right) was located right beside the Optical Disk Drive (left).

  <h3>Optical Disk Drive</h3>
  <p>
    IDK.
  </p>

      Here is our Optical Disk Drive.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    An optical drive in a PC framework enables you to utilize Cds, DVDs, and Blu-beam plates to tune in to music or watch a film. 
    Most drives additionally enable you to compose information to a plate, so you can make your own music Albums or make a reinforcement
    duplicate of critical information. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Definition: An optical circle drive (ODD) utilizes a laser light to peruse information from or compose information to an optical 
    plate. These incorporate Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-beam circles. This enables you to play music or watch motion pictures 
    utilizing pre-recorded circles. PC programming likewise frequently goes ahead one of these circles, so you require an optical drive 
    to introduce programming. Most current drives enable you to keep in touch with an unfilled circle, so you can make your own music 
    Discs or make a reinforcement duplicate of critical information. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Parts: An optical plate drive utilizes a laser to peruse and compose information. A laser in this setting implies an electromagnetic
    wave with a particular wavelength inside or close to the obvious light range. Diverse kinds of plates require distinctive 
    wavelengths. For minimized circles, or Discs, a wavelength of 780 nanometers (nm) is utilized, which is in the infrared range. For advanced 
    video plates, or DVDs, a wavelength of 650 nm (red) is utilized, while for Blu-beam circles a wavelength of 405 nm (violet) is 
    utilized. 
  </p>
  <p>
    An optical drive that can work with various kinds of plates will along these lines contain numerous lasers. The component to peruse 
    and compose information comprises of a laser, a focal point to direct the laser shaft, and photodiodes to identify the light 
    reflection from the circle. The optical components for perusing Cds and DVDs are very comparable, so a similar focal point can be 
    utilized for the two sorts of plates. The component for pursuing Blu-beam plates, in any case, is very unique. An optical drive 
    that works with a wide range of plates will in this way have two separate focal points: one for Compact disc/DVD and one for 
    Blu-beam.
