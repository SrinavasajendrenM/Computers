  <h3 class="intro">Welcome to our group's HTML website for the Hardware Project</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, we will be exploring the computer system, specifically the pieces of hardware 
    that make it up. Here are the main things that will be covered:
    <ul>
      <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU / Processor)</li>
      <li>Motherboard (Mainboard / System Board / Logicboard / MoBo)</li>
      <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
      <li>Floppy Disk Drive (FDD)</li>
      <li>Optical Disk Drive (ODD / CD/DVD-ROM Drive)</li>
      <li>Random Access Memory (RAM / Memory)</li>
      <li>Computer Case (System Unit / Computer Chassis / Tower / Base Unit / Case)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's get started on how the Computer looked before we deconstructed it...

        being taken.</figcaption>

  <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The CPU was one of the first parts our group had managed to pull out of the computer, and is 
    commonly referred to as the "brains" of a computer. The CPU is also known as the processor. The 
    CPU is responsible for executing a program.
    It is responsible for two things:
     - Carrying out commands to make the hardware components perform actions. 
     - Processing data; controls the execution of a computer and which performs basic arithmetic and 
       logical operations. 
    Although the instructions performed by the CPU are relatively simple, the CPU can execute many 
    millions of instructions every second. This is what makes the PC such a powerful tool.

        the Floppy Disk Drive (right).</figcaption>

  <h3>Motherboard</h3>
  <p>
    Although we had managed to take out the CPU quickly, the motherboard took quite a while to detach, 
    it is a printed circuit board that is known as the foundation of a computer. It allocates power and 
    allows communication to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components.
