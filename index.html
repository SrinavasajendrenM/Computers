  <h3 class="intro">Welcome to our group's HTML website for the Hardware Project</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, we will be exploring the computer system, specifically the pieces of hardware 
    that make it up. Here are the main things that will be covered:
  </p>
  <div class= "wrapper">

  <h3>Computer Case</h3>
  <p>
    Let's get started on how the computer looked before we deconstructed it...
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="beforeconstruction.jpg" alt="Before PC Deconstruction">
    <figcaption>
      As you can see, opening the computer case was all we had done prior to this picture being taken.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    A computer case, otherwise called a computer chassis, tower, system unit, cabinet, base unit, or simply case, is the fenced in area 
    that contains the greater part of the components of a computer (more often not including the display, keyboard, and mouse). The 
    material usually used to create cases are SECC—Steel, electrogalvanized (created by applying zinc and strip by electrodeposition), 
    icy moved, curl, or aluminum. Plastic is some of the time utilized, and different materials, for instance, glass, wood and even 
    Lego blocks have showed up in do it yourself or home-built cases. The computer case protects and holds together all the pieces that 
    are mandatory for a computer to function.
  </p>

  <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The CPU was one of the first parts our group had managed to pull out of the computer, it is commonly referred to as the "brains" of 
    a computer. The CPU is also known as the processor. The CPU is responsible for executing a program.
    It is responsible for two things:
  </p>
  <div class= "wrapper">
    <ul>
      <li>Carrying out commands to make the hardware components perform actions.</li> 
      <li>Processing data; controls the execution of a computer and which performs basic arithmetic and logical operations.</li> 
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    Although the instructions performed by the CPU are relatively simple, the CPU can execute many millions of instructions every second. 
    This is what makes the PC such a powerful tool.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="floppydiskandCPU.jpg" alt="Central Processing Unit">
    <figcaption>
      Our computer was using an Intel® Pentium® 4 processor (top-left), seen here beside the Floppy Disk Drive (right).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The CPU is a scaled down electronic segment that can be alluded to as the mind of the PC. It is in charge of two things: 
  </p>
  <div class= "wrapper">
    <ul>
      <li>It creates orders to influence the equipment segments to perform activities.</li> 
      <li>Processes information; controls the execution of a PC and which performs fundamental math and sensible operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    Despite the fact that the directions performed by the CPU are moderately straightforward, the CPU can execute a large number of 
    guidelines consistently. This is the thing that makes the PC such an intense device. 
  </p>

  <h3>CPU Cooling Fan</h3>
  <p>
    We had already detached the CPU cooling fan, and heatsink, prior to detaching the CPU, it removes the waste heat produced by the 
    CPU, to keep it within permissible operating temperature limits.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="fan2.jpg" alt="CPU Cooling Fan">
    <figcaption>
      The cooling fan (right) and heatsink (left) were mounted on top of the CPU.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <hr>
  <h3>Motherboard</h3>
  <p>
    Although we had managed to take out the CPU quickly, the motherboard took quite a while to detach, 
    it is a printed circuit board that is known as the foundation of a computer. It allocates power and 
    allows communication to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components. 
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="motherboard2.jpg" alt="Motherboard">
    <figcaption>
      Our motherboard was located at the bottom of our computer case.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The motherboard holds the CPU, memory chips (RAM and ROM), development spaces, control connectors and some other microchips 
    required for the PC to work. On the other hand alluded to as the mainboard, mboard, mobo, mobd, backplane load up, base load up, 
    fundamental circuit load up, planar load up, framework load up, or a rationale load up on Macintosh PCs. The motherboard is a 
    printed circuit board that is the establishment of a PC, situated on the posterior or at the base of the PC undercarriage. It 
    dispenses control and enables correspondence to the CPU, Slam, and all other PC equipment parts. 
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Riser Card</h3>
  <p>
    We managed to detach the riser card immediately after pulling out the motherboard, it is a board that 
    plugs into the motherboard and provides additional expansion slots. Because it rises above 
    the motherboard, it enables you to connect additional adapters to the system in an orientation that 
    is parallel to the system board and save space within the computer case.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="PCIRiserCard.jpg" alt="Riser Card">
    <figcaption>
      Our riser card was connected to the motherboard, located by the PSU.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    A riser card is a printed circuit board that picks up a multitude of signal lines (often bused) via a single connector 
    (usually an edge connector) on a motherboard and distributes them via dedicated connectors on the card.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Riser Cable</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="PCIERisercable.jpg" alt="This is the riser cable.">
    <figcaption>
      IDK.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    These cables are commonly used to connect multiple video cards to a motherboard by "lifting them" off and away from the motherboard.
    This also allows for more efficient cooling, thereby increasing the life of the cards, as well as possibly running at higher speeds.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Random Access Memory (RAM / memory)</h3>
  <p>
    We only had one stick of RAM.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="RAM.jpg" alt="RAM or also known as Random Access Memory.">
    <figcaption>
      The RAM was really easy to take out beause you don't need to unscrew or unplug any cables.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    RAM is utilized as a method for briefly saving data utilized by different segments of a PC. Any data inside RAM will be lost when a 
    PC is reset or fueled off. For instance, the CPU uses RAM for the transitory stockpiling of projects and information. 
    The primary memory that enables projects and information to be stacked for execution. 
    Temporary (short term or volatile) memory and the contents in it can be overwritten.
    Holds the program and information that the CPU is at present preparing. 
    Advantage: by adding more RAM to a PC, the execution of the PC upgrades and more projects can be introduced and keep running in the 
    meantime. Disadvantage: if power loss happens, all the contents that were stored in the memory are lost.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Power Supply Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The PSU was the last part our group pulled out of the computer, it sends low-voltage power to the 
    internal components of a computer. Modern PCs universally use power supplies with switches. Some power 
    supplies have a manual switch for selecting the input and output voltage, while others automatically 
    adapt to the source.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="powersupply.jpg" alt="Power Supply Unit">
    <figcaption>
      Our computer's Power Supply Unit was screwed into the Computer Case, and had a protective cover, so it took quite some time to 
      take it out.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The power supply is in charge of changing over the approaching power supply to the 5v and 12v DC control that is required by the PC.
    The 5v supply is utilized to control the circuit sheets on the PC. The 12v supply is utilized to control engine driven gadgets, for 
    example, hard drives or Compact disc ROMs. 
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
  <p>
    The FDD was one of the first parts our groups had managed to pull out of the computer, it is a magnetic 
    storage drive for computers. The floppy disk is composed of a thin, flexible magnetic disk sealed in a 
    square plastic carrier (it looks like the save icon on most word-processing applications). In order to 
    read and write data from a floppy disk, a computer system must have a floppy disk drive.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="floppydisk+DVDdrive2.jpg" alt="Floppy Disk Drive and DVD drive">
    <figcaption>
      Our computer's Floppy Disk Drive (right) was located right beside the Optical Disk Drive (left).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    A floppy disk, also called a floppy, diskette, or just disk, is a type of disk storage composed of a disk of thin and flexible 
    magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic enclosure lined with fabric that removes dust particles. Floppy disks are 
    read and written by a floppy disk drive (FDD).
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Optical Disk Drive</h3>
  <p>
    IDK.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="floppydisk+DVDdrive2.jpg" alt="Floppy Disk Drive and DVD drive">
    <figcaption>
      Here is our Optical Disk Drive.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Definition: An optical circle drive (ODD) utilizes a laser light to peruse information from or compose information to an optical 
    plate. These incorporate Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-beam circles. This enables you to play music or watch motion pictures 
    utilizing pre-recorded circles. PC programming likewise frequently goes ahead one of these circles, so you require an optical drive 
    to introduce programming. Most current drives enable you to keep in touch with an unfilled circle, so you can make your own music 
    Discs or make a reinforcement duplicate of critical information. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Parts: An optical plate drive utilizes a laser to peruse and compose information. A laser in this setting implies an electromagnetic
    wave with a particular wavelength inside or close to the obvious light range. Diverse kinds of plates require distinctive 
    wavelengths. For minimized circles, or Discs, a wavelength of 780 nanometers (nm) is utilized, which is in the infrared range. 
    For advanced video plates, or DVDs, a wavelength of 650 nm (red) is utilized, while for Blu-beam circles a wavelength of 405 nm 
    (violet) is utilized.

  <h3>How Does it all work?</h3>
  <p>
    A computer has two main parts. The software and hardware. The software has all the instructions, including the operating system, 
    programs, and applications, needed to run properly. The hardware has all the physical elements that make the computer work, such 
    as the RAM, CPU, ROM, cache, etc. Let’s imagine a restaurant. Everyday, the keeper comes and makes sure that everything is ready 
    and good to go. The keeper in a computer is the ROM or Read Only Memory, which can’t be modified. To keep everything running 
    properly in the restaurant, we need an administrator. The administrator is the CPU or central processing unit. The CPU contains 
    the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU). The ALU in a restaurant would be the manager, who takes care of the numbers
    and logical part of the job. The CU would be the head chef who organizes the incoming information and gives everyone a task. Let’s 
    say a customer makes an order. The order would act as input data. A waiter or databus then carries this information to the kitchen. 
    The data then goes through the head chef, who decides where it should go. The kitchen would represent our motherboard. Inside, 
    there is a fridge where we keep everything we use frequently for easy access. This would be called the Random Access Memory or RAM. 
    There is another type of RAM called cache, but this one would be considered a small recipe book in the kitchen in which the PC 
    keeps the frequently used instructions. There is also a warehouse with a bigger capacity, which works out to be the hard disk. 
    Also, things can be delivered through the backdoor, which could be considered the optical disk in the PC. Imagine that we also have 
    a timer in the kitchen. Every time the timer starts, everyone has to begin preparing the dish and you have to get it done by the 
    time it reaches zero. This keeps everything synchronized. In the computer, it would be called the internal clock.  When the cooks 
    prepare the food, this would be the task of the video card in the computer, which would be converting data into images.
