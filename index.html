  <h3 class="intro">Welcome to our group's HTML website for the Hardware Project</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, we will be exploring the computer system, specifically the pieces of hardware 
    that make it up. Here are the main things that will be covered:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU / Processor)</li>
    <li>CPU Cooling Fans</li>
    <li>Motherboard (Mainboard / System Board / Logicboard / MoBo)</li>
    <li>Riser Card</li>
    <li>Riser Cable</li>
    <li>Random Access Memory (RAM / Memory)</li>
    <li>Hard Disk Drive (HDD / Hard Drive / Storage)</li>
    <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
    <li>Floppy Disk Drive (FDD)</li>
    <li>Optical Disk Drive (ODD / CD/DVD-ROM Drive)</li>
    <li>Computer Case (System Unit / Computer Chassis / Tower / Base Unit / Case)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>
    Let's get started on how the Computer looked before we deconstructed it...
  </p>
    <br>

        being taken.</figcaption>
  <br>
  <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The CPU was one of the first parts our group had managed to pull out of the computer, it is 
    commonly referred to as the "brains" of a computer. The CPU is also known as the processor. The 
    CPU is responsible for executing a program.
    <br>
    It is responsible for two things:
     - Carrying out commands to make the hardware components perform actions. 
     - Processing data; controls the execution of a computer and which performs basic arithmetic and 
       logical operations. 
    <br>
    Although the instructions performed by the CPU are relatively simple, the CPU can execute many 
    millions of instructions every second. This is what makes the PC such a powerful tool.
    <br>

        the Floppy Disk Drive (right).</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <p>
    The CPU is a scaled down electronic segment that can be alluded to as the mind of the PC. It is in charge of two things: It creates orders to influence the equipment segments to perform activities. 
    Processes information; controls the execution of a PC and which performs fundamental math and sensible operations. Despite the fact that the directions performed by the CPU are moderately straightforward, the CPU can execute a large number of guidelines consistently. This is the thing that makes the PC such an intense device. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>CPU Cooling Fan</h3>
  <p>
    We had already detached the CPU cooling fan, and heatsink, prior to detaching the CPU, it removes 
    the waste heat produced by the CPU, to keep it within permissible operating temperature limits.
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="fan2.jpg" alt="CPU Cooling Fan">
      <figcaption>The cooling fan (right) and heatsink (left) were mounted on top of the CPU.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Motherboard</h3>
  <p>
    Although we had managed to take out the CPU quickly, the motherboard took quite a while to detach, 
    it is a printed circuit board that is known as the foundation of a computer. It allocates power and 
    allows communication to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components. 
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="motherboard2.jpg" alt="Motherboard">
      <figcaption>Our motherboard was located at the bottom of our computer case.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Riser Card</h3>
  <p>
    We managed to detach the riser card immediately after pulling out the motherboard, it is a board that 
    plugs into the motherboard and provides additional expansion slots. Because it rises above 
    the motherboard, it enables you to connect additional adapters to the system in an orientation that 
    is parallel to the system board and save space within the computer case.
    <br>

      <figcaption>Our riser card was connected to the motherboard, located by the PSU.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Power Supply Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The PSU was the last part our group pulled out of the computer, it sends low-voltage power to the 
    internal components of a computer. Modern PCs universally use power supplies with switches. Some power 
    supplies have a manual switch for selecting the input and output voltage, while others automatically 
    adapt to the source.
    <br>

      <figcaption>Our computer's Power Supply Unit was screwed into the Computer Case, and had a protective 
        cover, so it took quite some time to take it out.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
  <p>
    The FDD was one of the first parts our groups had managed to pull out of the computer, it is a magnetic 
    storage drive for computers. The floppy disk is composed of a thin, flexible magnetic disk sealed in a 
    square plastic carrier (it looks like the save icon on most word-processing applications). In order to 
    read and write data from a floppy disk, a computer system must have a floppy disk drive.

        (left).</figcaption>
