  <h3 class="intro">Welcome to our group's HTML website for the Hardware Project</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, we will be exploring the computer system, specifically the pieces of hardware 
    that make it up. Here are the main things that will be covered:
    <ul>
      <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU / Processor)</li>
      <li>Motherboard (Mainboard / System Board / Logicboard / MoBo)</li>
      <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
      <li>Floppy Disk Drive (FDD)</li>
      <li>Optical Disk Drive (ODD / CD/DVD-ROM Drive)</li>
      <li>Random Access Memory (RAM / Memory)</li>
      <li>Computer Case (System Unit / Computer Chassis / Tower / Base Unit / Case)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Let's get started on how the Computer looked before we deconstructed it...
    <br>

        being taken.</figcaption>

  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The CPU was one of the first parts our group had managed to pull out of the computer, it is 
    commonly referred to as the "brains" of a computer. The CPU is also known as the processor. The 
    CPU is responsible for executing a program.
    <br>
    It is responsible for two things:
     - Carrying out commands to make the hardware components perform actions. 
     - Processing data; controls the execution of a computer and which performs basic arithmetic and 
       logical operations. 
    <br>
    Although the instructions performed by the CPU are relatively simple, the CPU can execute many 
    millions of instructions every second. This is what makes the PC such a powerful tool.

        the Floppy Disk Drive (right).</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Motherboard</h3>
  <p>
    Although we had managed to take out the CPU quickly, the motherboard took quite a while to detach, 
    it is a printed circuit board that is known as the foundation of a computer. It allocates power and 
    allows communication to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components.

  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Power Supply Unit</h3>
  <p>
    The PSU was the last part our group pulled out of the computer, it sends low-voltage power to the 
    internal components of a computer. Modern PCs universally use power supplies with switches. Some power 
    supplies have a manual switch for selecting the input and output voltage, while others automatically 
    adapt to the source.

      <figcaption>Our computer's Power Supply Unit was screwed into the Computer Case, and had a protective 
        cover, so it took quite some time to take it out.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
  <p>
    The FDD was one of the first parts our groups had managed to pull out of the computer, it is a magnetic 
    storage drive for computers. The floppy disk is composed of a thin, flexible magnetic disk sealed in a 
    square plastic carrier (it looks like the save icon on most word-processing applications). In order to 
    read and write data from a floppy disk, a computer system must have a floppy disk drive.
